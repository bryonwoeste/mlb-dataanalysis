# Experiment 001: Baseline Model

Date: 2026-02-06

## Question
Can batter and pitcher season stats alone predict plate appearance outcomes?

## Hypothesis
Batter strikeout rate and pitcher strikeout rate will strongly predict strikeouts.
Home runs will be harder to predict.

## Planned Variables

Batter:
- K%
- BB%
- ISO

Pitcher:
- K%
- BB%
- HR/9

## Notes
This will serve as the baseline model for future comparison.
